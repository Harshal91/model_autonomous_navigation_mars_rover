# Autonomous Navigation of a Mars rover

% Copyright 2023-2024 The MathWorks, Inc.

Curious about how a Mars rover autonomously plans and navigates its path, millions of miles away? In this workshop, participants will work with a virtual model of a six-wheeled autonomous rover and help it navigate uncharted terrains. Participants will use sensor data to estimate the rover position, deep learning to detect obstacles, path-planning algorithms to design an optimal path for the rover, and a 6-DOF arm to pick up a soil sample and complete the mission. Participants will see how deep learning and computer vision tools can inform and improve traditional path-planning algorithms, and they will leave the workshop empowered to work on autonomous navigation and robotics challenges in their own areas of application. This workshop demonstrates how MATLAB® and Simulink® can be used together to model a challenging application. The entire application is modeled within a single simulation environment using the following products:

MATLAB®: offline path planning, camera sensors, and front end for demo

Deep Learning Toolbox™: perception module and rock detection

Simscape Multibody™: rover plant model, contact mechanics, and virtual terrain

Computer Vision Toolbox™ and Image Processing Toolbox™: depth estimation of detected rocks

Robotics System Toolbox™ and Navigation Toolbox™: path planning and controls

To launch the app run the following command :
